# House-Price-Prediction

# Data
In this paper I use statistics techniques to analyse the price of House in Sydney and Melbourne. 
I was able to understand the data and ready it for processing. To examine and predict the data, appropriate models such as
clusters and regressions were created. In the final section of this research, 
models were interpreted to generate an idea of property prices in Sydney and Melbourne.
